What is poo 
made of?
Dietary fiber helps keep you 
healthy by feeding friendly 
bacteria in your large intestine 
and by making poo bulkier  
and therefore easier to push 
along. Foods rich in fiber 
include beans, whole wheat, 
and vegetables such as corn.DIETARY FIBERPoo isn’t just undigested food. 
About half of its weight 
consists of microscopic 
organisms called bacteria. 
They come from your 
microbiome—an ecosystem  
of organisms living in  
and on your body.
An average 
human poo 
contains about 
250 microscopic 
particles of 
plastic.Live bacteria
make up about  
a quarter of poo. 
Poo is a living 
substance, with 
more than 1,000 
species of bacteria. 
It also contains 
smaller numbers of 
viruses, fungi, and 
microorganisms called 
protists and archaea.
